Descriptive Analytics focuses on understanding what happened in the past by analyzing historical data. It can provide insights on key performance metrics, such as inventory levels, lead times, and delivery performance. Descriptive analytics can help identify patterns and trends in past supply chain operations, allowing organizations to make informed decisions about future strategies.\n","\n","2. Diagnostic Analytics goes beyond descriptive analytics by identifying the root causes of supply chain issues. By analyzing data from different sources, such as suppliers, logistics providers, and customers, organizations can identify the factors that contribute to delays, disruptions, or quality issues in their supply chain. This can help them take corrective actions to prevent similar problems from happening in the future.\n","\n","3. Predictive Analytics uses statistical models and machine learning algorithms to forecast future supply chain events. By analyzing historical data, organizations can identify patterns and trends that can help predict demand, inventory levels, and delivery performance. This can help organizations optimize their supply chain operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.\n","\n","4. Prescriptive Analytics takes predictive analytics one step further by providing recommendations on how to optimize supply chain operations. By using optimization algorithms and simulations, prescriptive analytics can help organizations identify the best course of action to improve supply chain performance. This can help organizations make better decisions and improve their overall supply chain efficiency.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"16efe57c","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002612,"end_time":"2023-06-01T16:33:46.583067","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-01T16:33:46.580455","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# How to conduct supply chain analysis\n","\n","- The above analytics should be used when conducting supply chain analysis.
